This site is an automated news aggregator. It fetches news from multiple RSS feeds, presenting them all on a single page for your convenience. The news primarily focuses on .NET content, but also includes topics such as cloud computing, containers, DevOps, and Generative AI, among others.

The site is automatically updated every 1 hour with the latest news from various RSS feeds.

There is also a lot of interesting .NET content in Youtube, that's why this site also contains a videos section. This section is automatically updated once every day at 07:15 AM (UTC) with the videos posted the day before.

If you wish to contribute by adding a Youtube channel or a RSS feed from your own site or a site you favor, please visit the "Contribute" section.

Should you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on **GitHub** or **LinkedIn**.
