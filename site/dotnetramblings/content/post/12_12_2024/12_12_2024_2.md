In Part 1 of this series, we introduced the newly launched ModelTrainer class on the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK and its benefits, and showed you how to fine-tune a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model on a custom dataset. In this post, we look at the enhancements to the ModelBuilder class, which lets you seamlessly deploy a model from ModelTrainer to a SageMaker endpoint, and provides a single interface for multiple deployment configurations.
