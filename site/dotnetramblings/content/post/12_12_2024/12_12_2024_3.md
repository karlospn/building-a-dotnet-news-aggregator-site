In this post, we focus on the ModelTrainer class for simplifying the training experience. The ModelTrainer class provides significant improvements over the current Estimator class, which are discussed in detail in this post. We show you how to use the ModelTrainer class to train your ML models, which includes executing distributed training using a custom script or container. In Part 2, we show you how to build a model and deploy to a SageMaker endpoint using the improved ModelBuilder class.
