Suppose you have a large block of memory, and you want to swap two blocks that reside inside that large block. For concreteness, say you have a block of memory of the form A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, E1, and you want to swap the B's and D's, producing A1, A2, D1, D2, D3, C1, C2, B1, B2, E1.
