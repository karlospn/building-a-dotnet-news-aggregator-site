In this post, we demonstrate how to use Foundation Models (FMs) from Amazon Bedrock and the newly launched Amazon Bedrock AgentCore alongside W&B Weave to help build, evaluate, and monitor enterprise AI solutions. We cover the complete development lifecycle from tracking individual FM calls to monitoring complex agent workflows in production.
