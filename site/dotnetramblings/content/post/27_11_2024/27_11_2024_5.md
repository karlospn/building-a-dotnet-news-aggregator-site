In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock Agents simplify the orchestration of generative AI workflows, particularly with the introduction of the custom orchestrator feature. You can use the custom orchestrator to fine-tune and optimize agentic workflows that align more closely with specific business and operational needs. We outline the featureâ€™s key benefits, including full control over orchestration, real-time adjustments, and reusability, followed by a breakdown of how it manages state transitions and contract-based interactions between Amazon Bedrock Agents and AWS Lambda.
