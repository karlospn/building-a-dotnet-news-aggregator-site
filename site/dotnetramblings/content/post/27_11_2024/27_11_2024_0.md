In this post, we demonstrate Embodied AI Chess with Amazon Bedrock, bringing a new dimension to traditional chess through generative AI capabilities. Our setup features a smart chess board that can detect moves in real time, paired with two robotic arms executing those moves. Each arm is controlled by different FMsâ€”base or custom. This physical implementation allows you to observe and experiment with how different generative AI models approach complex gaming strategies in real-world chess matches.
