In this post, we propose a solution using DigitalDhan, a generative AI-based solution to automate customer onboarding and digital lending. The proposed solution uses Amazon Bedrock Agents to automate services related to KYC verification, credit and risk assessment, and notification. Financial institutions can use this solution to help automate the customer onboarding, KYC verification, credit decisioning, credit underwriting, and notification processes.
