This post discusses how to use AWS Step Functions to efficiently coordinate multi-step generative AI workflows, such as parallelizing API calls to Amazon Bedrock to quickly gather answers to lists of submitted questions. We also touch on the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to optimize outputs and provide an extra layer of precision, as well as other possible integrations through Step Functions.
