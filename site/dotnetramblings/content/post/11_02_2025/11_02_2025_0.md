We are excited to announce that Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) 2.1 vision segmentation model is publicly available through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to deploy and run inference. Meta SAM 2.1 provides state-of-the-art video and image segmentation capabilities in a single model. In this post, we explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including Meta’s most advanced and capable models to date.
