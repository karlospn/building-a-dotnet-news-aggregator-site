GraphStorm is a low-code enterprise graph machine learning (ML) framework that provides ML practitioners a simple way of building, training, and deploying graph ML solutions on industry-scale graph data. In this post, we demonstrate how GraphBolt enhances GraphStormâ€™s performance in distributed settings. We provide a hands-on example of using GraphStorm with GraphBolt on SageMaker for distributed training. Lastly, we share how to use Amazon SageMaker Pipelines with GraphStorm.
