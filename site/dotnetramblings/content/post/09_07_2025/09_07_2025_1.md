The business team in Parcel Perform often needs access to data to answer questions related to merchants’ parcel deliveries, such as “Did we see a spike in delivery delays last week? If so, in which transit facilities were this observed, and what was the primary cause of the issue?” Previously, the data team had to manually form the query and run it to fetch the data. With the new generative AI-powered text-to-SQL capability in Parcel Perform, the business team can self-serve their data needs by using an AI assistant interface. In this post, we discuss how Parcel Perform incorporated generative AI, data storage, and data access through AWS services to make timely decisions.
