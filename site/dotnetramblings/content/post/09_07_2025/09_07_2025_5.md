n this two-part series, we discuss a hub and spoke architecture pattern for building a multi-tenant and multi-account architecture. This pattern supports abstractions for shared services across use cases and teams, helping create secure, scalable, and reliable generative AI systems. In Part 1, we present a centralized hub for generative AI service abstractions and tenant-specific spokes, using AWS Transit Gateway for cross-account interoperability.
