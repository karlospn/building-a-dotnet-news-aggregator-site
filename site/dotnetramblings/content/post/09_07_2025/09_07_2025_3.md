In this post, we demonstrate how to use SageMaker Unified Studio and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to establish a robust permission framework for Amazon Bedrock models. We show how administrators can precisely manage which users and teams have access to specific models within a secure, collaborative environment. We guide you through creating granular permissions to control model access, with code examples for common enterprise governance scenarios.
