In this post, we will walk through the performance constraints and design choices by OARC and REMAP teams at UCLA, including how AWS serverless infrastructure, AWS Managed Services, and generative AI services supported the rapid design and deployment of our solution. We will also describe our use of Amazon SageMaker AI and how it can be used reliably in immersive live experiences.
