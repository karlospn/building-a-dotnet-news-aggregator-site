Gardenia Technologies, a data analytics company, partnered with the AWS Prototyping and Cloud Engineering (PACE) team to develop Report GenAI, a fully automated ESG reporting solution powered by the latest generative AI models on Amazon Bedrock. This post dives deep into the technology behind an agentic search solution using tooling with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL capabilities to help customers reduce ESG reporting time by up to 75%.
