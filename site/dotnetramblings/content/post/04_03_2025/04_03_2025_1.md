In this post, we explore a generative AI solution leveraging Amazon Bedrock to streamline the WAFR process. We demonstrate how to harness the power of LLMs to build an intelligent, scalable system that analyzes architecture documents and generates insightful recommendations based on AWS Well-Architected best practices. This solution automates portions of the WAFR report creation, helping solutions architects improve the efficiency and thoroughness of architectural assessments while supporting their decision-making process.
