.NET version 8 introduced the FrozenSet type, offering immutable and hashable set collection with benefits including improved performance, memory efficiency, and thread safety. Benchmarks show comparable performance to List, outperforming HashSet and ImmutableHashSet. However, it is slightly slower than the latter in lookups. FrozenSet offers significant advantages for concurrent applications and memory optimization.
