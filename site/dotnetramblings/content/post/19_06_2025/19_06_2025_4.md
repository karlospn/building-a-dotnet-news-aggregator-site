Starting July 14, 2025, the AWS DeepRacer Student Portal will enter a maintenance phase where new registrations will be disabled. Until September 15, 2025, existing users will retain full access to their content and training materials, with updates limited to critical security fixes, after which the portal will no longer be available.
