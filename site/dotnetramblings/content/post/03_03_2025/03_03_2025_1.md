This guide demonstrates how to deploy an open source foundation model from Hugging Face on Amazon EC2 instances across three locations: a commercial AWS Region and two AWS Local Zones. Through comparative benchmarking tests, we illustrate how deploying foundation models in Local Zones closer to end users can significantly reduce latencyâ€”a critical factor for real-time applications such as conversational AI assistants.
