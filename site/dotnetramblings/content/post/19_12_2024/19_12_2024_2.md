This post provides step-by-step instructions for creating a collaborative multi-agent framework with reasoning capabilities to decouple business applications from FMs. It demonstrates how to combine Amazon Bedrock Agents with open source multi-agent frameworks, enabling collaborations and reasoning among agents to dynamically execute various tasks. The exercise will guide you through the process of building a reasoning orchestration system using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Agents, and FMs. We also explore the integration of Amazon Bedrock Agents with open source orchestration frameworks LangGraph and CrewAI for dispatching and reasoning.
