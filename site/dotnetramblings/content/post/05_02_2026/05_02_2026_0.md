Associa collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to build a generative AI-powered document classification system aligning with Associa’s long-term vision of using generative AI to achieve operational efficiencies in document management. The solution automatically categorizes incoming documents with high accuracy, processes documents efficiently, and provides substantial cost savings while maintaining operational excellence. The document classification system, developed using the Generative AI Intelligent Document Processing (GenAI IDP) Accelerator, is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. It revolutionizes how employees interact with document management systems by reducing the time spent on manual classification tasks.
