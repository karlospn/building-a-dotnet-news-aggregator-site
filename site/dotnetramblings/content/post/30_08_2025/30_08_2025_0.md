Weekly Recap
Sales, Rejection, And Founding an AI Startup -  Interview With Amer Tadayon



 Sometimes our original plans don't work out -- but what a masterpiece when our different paths come together for something awesome!


 I was happy to sit down with Amer Tadayon and discuss his journey leading up to the creation of Lucihub.


 One of the most important parts of this story I found was that not every path we pick will be perfect -- and that's 100% okay. What matters is that we keep adjusting and moving forward.


 For Amer, all roads led to Lucihub! Thanks for the awesome chat!

Dependency Injection, Semantic Kernel, and Upcoming Coding Projects



 Here are some of the upcoming projects that I am going to be spending some time on when it comes to videos on my main YouTube channel!

How To Use Claude Code To Write Tests For Your Code - Is It Worth It?!



 This tutorial provides instructions on guiding Claude Code to write tests for your code base. I use Claude Flow on top of Claude Code to orchestrate an agentic swarm to tackle it. But how did it do?

Psychology To Software Engineering - Interview With Sofia Sarhiri



 One of my favorite things about interviewing developers is hearing their stories! And Sofia had a great story to share about her career switch into software development!


 I really enjoyed this conversation and the focus on just how valuable soft skills are. You'll hear about Sofia's experiences and how communication plays a big role!


 Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences, Sofia!

The Top Mistakes Of New Team Leads and Managers - Principal Engineering Manager AMA



 Transitioning from a pure individual contributor (IC) role isn't an easy thing. It's a big transition, and there are a lot of things to learn and adjust to. Let's chat through some of the common challenges folks face as they make these transitions.


 As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

How I Use Chat GPT to Write Design Specs... For Claude Code to Use!



 Here's a walkthrough of how I go back-and-forth with Chat GPT to get a design spec put together. This is just an example, and of course, you should spend more time and refine the output that it gives you.


 In the follow up, we walk through the code that gets built and see how we can improve it!

Be The Luck For Other Software Engineers - Interview With Scott Hanselman



 Arguably the coolest thing I've been able to do in my content creation journey for software engineers to date:


 I got to sit down and chat with Scott Hanselman.


 I bet that the overwhelming majority of my audience knows Scott. It's almost impossible to be in this area of tech and not know him! If you've seen a 3d printer online you definitely know Scott.


 Scott is the VP of Developer Community of Microsoft -- but if you ask him, he's happy to simply say "I'm a teacher". 


 For those of us who know him, we've all learned a great deal from him. If this is your introduction to Scott, then I'm sure you'll be hooked on his content. 


 Thanks for being the luck that so many software engineers need, Scott.

Minimizing Boilerplate C# By Refactoring With Needlr



 Claude followed a spec that I gave it from ChatGPT... but oh MAN was it rough code. The reality is that it worked -- but it was pretty gnarly. So in this video I walk through how I can start to clean up all of the dependency injection to use Needlr.

The Secret To Better Feedback At Work!



 I had an engineer ask for feedback in a VERY effective way, and I wanted to share this anecdote with you so that you can think of how you might apply it.

Here's Why I Fearlessly Ask Stupid Questions As An Engineering Manager



 Everyone is afraid of asking questions and looking stupid as a software engineer. Here's exactly why, as an engineering manager, I try to make sure I am leaning into asking questions that might be perceived as dumb -- and why I need to do it fearlessly.

The Truth About Our Code's Responsibility - Interview With Thimo Koolen



 I was thrilled to have Thimo Koolen join me on the Dev Leader Podcast. We dug into the responsibility that comes with being a software engineer when the systems we build touch industries like healthcare and transportation.


 Thimo shared great advice for new developers: get hands-on, build real things, and apply what you learn instead of just consuming tutorials. We also explored the role of AI in software engineering, why fundamentals still matter, and how juniors can navigate today’s market without falling into Tutorial Hell.


 What stood out most to me was the reminder that our code isn’t just code -- it impacts people’s lives. Whether you’re just starting out or growing into senior roles, there’s a lot to take away from this conversation. I’m grateful Thimo made the time to share his journey and insights!
