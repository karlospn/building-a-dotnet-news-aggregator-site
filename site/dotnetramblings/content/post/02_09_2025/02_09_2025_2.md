In this blog post, we demonstrate an end-to-end approach for building and evaluating a KIE solution using Amazon Nova models available through Amazon Bedrock. This end-to-end approach encompasses three critical phases: data readiness (understanding and preparing your documents), solution development (implementing extraction logic with appropriate models), and performance measurement (evaluating accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness). We illustrate this comprehensive approach using the FATURA datasetâ€”a collection of diverse invoice documents that serves as a representative proxy for real-world enterprise data.
