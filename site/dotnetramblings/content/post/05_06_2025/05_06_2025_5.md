Contextual retrieval enhances traditional RAG by adding chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk before generating embeddings. This approach enriches the vector representation with relevant contextual information, enabling more accurate retrieval of semantically related content when responding to user queries. In this post, we demonstrate how to use contextual retrieval with Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.
