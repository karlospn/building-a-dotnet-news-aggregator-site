In this post, we provide insights and practical examples to help balance and optimize the prompt engineering workflow. We focus on advanced prompt techniques and best practices for the models provided in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API. With these prompting techniques, developers and researchers can harness the full capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, providing clear and concise communication while mitigating potential risks or undesirable outputs.
