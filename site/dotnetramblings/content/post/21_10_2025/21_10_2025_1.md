In this post, we explore how Amazon Nova Sonic's speech-to-speech capabilities can be combined with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to create sophisticated multi-agent voice assistants that break complex tasks into specialized, manageable components. The approach demonstrates how to build modular, scalable voice applications using a banking assistant example with dedicated sub-agents for authentication, banking inquiries, and mortgage services, offering a more maintainable alternative to monolithic voice assistant designs.
