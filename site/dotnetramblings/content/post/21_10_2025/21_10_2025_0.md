In this post, we walk through how to take an ML model built in SageMaker Canvas and deploy it using SageMaker Serverless Inference, helping you go from model creation to production-ready predictions quickly and efficiently without managing any infrastructure. This solution demonstrates a complete workflow from adding your trained model to the SageMaker Model Registry through creating serverless endpoint configurations and deploying endpoints that automatically scale based on demand .
