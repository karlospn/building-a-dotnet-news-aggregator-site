In this post, we explain how Cepsa Química and partner Keepler have implemented a generative AI assistant to increase the efficiency of the product stewardship team when answering compliance queries related to the chemical products they market. To accelerate development, they used Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy and safety.
