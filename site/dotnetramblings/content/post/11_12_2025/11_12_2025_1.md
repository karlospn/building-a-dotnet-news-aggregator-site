In this post, we'll show how Swisscom implemented Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build and scale their enterprise AI agents for customer support and sales operations. As an early adopter of Amazon Bedrock in the AWS Europe Region (Zurich), Swisscom leads in enterprise AI implementation with their Chatbot Builder system and various AI initiatives. Their successful deployments include Conversational AI powered by Rasa and fine-tuned LLMs on Amazon SageMaker, and the Swisscom Swisscom myAI assistant, built to meet Swiss data protection standards.
