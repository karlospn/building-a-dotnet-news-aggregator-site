Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving at a rapid pace, with machine learning techniques becoming more sophisticated and efficient. One of the biggest challenges in traditional AI training is the heavy reliance on labeled datasets, which require extensive human effort and resources. However, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is revolutionizing the field by enabling AI models to learn [â€¦]
