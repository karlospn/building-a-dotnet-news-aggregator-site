In this post, we explore how the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and Quora collaborated to build a unified wrapper API framework that dramatically accelerates the deployment of Amazon Bedrock FMs on Quora’s Poe system. We detail the technical architecture that bridges Poe’s event-driven ServerSentEvents protocol with Amazon Bedrock REST-based APIs, demonstrate how a template-based configuration system reduced deployment time from days to 15 minutes, and share implementation patterns for protocol translation, error handling, and multi-modal capabilities.
