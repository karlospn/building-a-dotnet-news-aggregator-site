In this post, we provide you with a comprehensive approach to achieve this. First, we introduce a context message strategy that maintains continuous communication between servers and clients during extended operations. Next, we develop an asynchronous task management framework that allows your AI agents to initiate long-running processes without blocking other operations. Finally, we demonstrate how to bring these strategies together with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Strands Agents to build production-ready AI agents that can handle complex, time-intensive operations reliably.
