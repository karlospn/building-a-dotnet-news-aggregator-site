In applications such as personalized recommendations and scientific research, accurately identifying the closest data points to a given query is crucial. Traditional methods like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search offer faster retrieval times by approximating results but may sacrifice accuracy, leading to potential errors in scenarios where precision is essential. This trade-off between speed and [â€¦]
