OpenSearch offers a wide range of third-party machine learning (ML) connectors to support this augmentation. This post highlights two of these third-party ML connectors. The first connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Comprehend connector. In this post, we show you how to use this connector to invoke the LangDetect API to detect the languages of ingested documents. The second connector we demonstrate is the Amazon Bedrock connector to invoke the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2 model so that you can create embeddings from ingested documents and perform semantic search.
