ZURU collaborated with AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and AWS Professional Services to implement a more accurate text-to-floor plan generator using generative AI. In this post, we show you why a solution using a large language model (LLM) was chosen. We explore how model selection, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be used to improve results.
