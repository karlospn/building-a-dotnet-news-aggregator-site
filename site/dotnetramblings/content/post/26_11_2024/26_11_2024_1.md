This post demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Knowledge Bases, and the RAGAS evaluation metrics to build a custom hallucination detector and remediate it by using human-in-the-loop. The agentic workflow can be extended to custom use cases through different hallucination remediation techniques and offers the flexibility to detect and mitigate hallucinations using custom actions.
