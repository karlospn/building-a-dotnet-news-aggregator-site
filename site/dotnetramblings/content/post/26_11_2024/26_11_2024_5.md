In this post, we demonstrate how to use models on Amazon Bedrock to retrieve information from images, tables, and scanned documents. We provide the following examples: 1/ performing object classification and object detection tasks, 2/ reading and querying graphs, and 3/ reading flowcharts and architecture diagrams (such as an AWS architecture diagram) and converting it to text.
