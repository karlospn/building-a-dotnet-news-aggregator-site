In this post you will learn how to use Spectrum to optimize resource use and shorten training times without sacrificing quality, as well as how to implement Spectrum fine-tuning with Amazon SageMaker AI training jobs. We will also discuss the tradeoff between QLoRA and Spectrum fine-tuning, showing that while QLoRA is more resource efficient, Spectrum results in higher performance overall.
