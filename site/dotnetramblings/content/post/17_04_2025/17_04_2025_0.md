Google’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is designed to enable seamless interoperability among diverse AI agents. Microsoft’s Semantic Kernel (SK), an open-source platform for orchestrating intelligent agent interactions, is now being integrated into the A2A ecosystem. In this blog, we demonstrate how Semantic Kernel agents can easily function as an A2A Server, efficiently routing agent calls to […]
