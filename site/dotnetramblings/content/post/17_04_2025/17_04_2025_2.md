Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) is a new managed feature powered by FMs in Amazon Bedrock. BDA extracts structured outputs from unstructured content—including documents, images, video, and audio—while alleviating the need for complex custom workflows. In this post, we demonstrate how BDA automatically extracts rich video insights such as chapter segments and audio segments, detects text in scenes, and classifies Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomies, and then uses these insights to build a nonlinear ads solution to enhance contextual advertising effectiveness.
