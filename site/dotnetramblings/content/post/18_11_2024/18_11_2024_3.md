In this post, we show you how DXC and AWS collaborated to build an AI assistant using large language models (LLMs), enabling users to access and analyze different data types from a variety of data sources. The AI assistant is powered by an intelligent agent that routes user questions to specialized tools that are optimized for different data types such as text, tables, and domain-specific formats. It uses the LLMâ€™s ability to understand natural language, write code, and reason about conversational context.
