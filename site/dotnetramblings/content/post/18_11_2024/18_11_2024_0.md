MSD, a leading pharmaceutical company, collaborates with AWS to implement a powerful text-to-SQL generative AI solution using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.

The solution addresses challenges such as coded columns, non-intuitive names, and ambiguous queries, significantly reducing query time and democratizing data access.
