In this post, we explain how InsuranceDekho harnessed the power of generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropicâ€™s Claude to provide responses to customer queries on policy coverages, exclusions, and more. This let our customer care agents and POSPs confidently help our customers understand the policies without reaching out to insurance subject matter experts (SMEs) or memorizing complex plans while providing sales and after-sales services. The use of this solution has improved sales, cross-selling, and overall customer service experience.
