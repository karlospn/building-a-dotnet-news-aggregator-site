In this post, we demonstrate how to interact with the Amazon Titan Image Generator G1 v2 model on Amazon Bedrock to generate an image. Then, we show you how to use Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock to describe it, evaluate it with a score from 1–10, explain the reason behind the given score, and suggest improvements to the image.
