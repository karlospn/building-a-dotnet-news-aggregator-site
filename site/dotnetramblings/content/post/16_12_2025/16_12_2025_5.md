In this post, we'll show how the TwelveLabs Marengo embedding model, available on Amazon Bedrock, enhances video understanding through multimodal AI. We'll build a video semantic search and analysis solution using embeddings from the Marengo model with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as the vector database, for semantic search capabilities that go beyond simple metadata matching to deliver intelligent content discovery.
