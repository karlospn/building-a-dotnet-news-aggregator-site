In this post, we show how climate tech startups are developing foundation models (FMs) that use extensive environmental datasets to tackle issues such as carbon capture, carbon-negative fuels, new materials design for microplastics destruction, and ecosystem preservation. These specialized models require advanced computational capabilities to process and analyze vast amounts of data effectively.
