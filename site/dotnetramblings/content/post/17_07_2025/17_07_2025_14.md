At OpenAI, we build tools to help people solve hard problems—including nonprofits working on the frontlines of their communities. The OpenAI Academy is teaming up with the Walton Family Foundation, Emerson Collective, and a network of local nonprofit organizations to host the Nonprofit Jam—a one-day, nationwide event bringing together more than 1,000 nonprofit leaders across 10 locations.
