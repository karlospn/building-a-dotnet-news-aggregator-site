This post explores the Real-Time Race Track (RTRT), an interactive experience built using Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock, that lets fans design, customize, and share their own racing circuits. We highlight how generative AI capabilities come together to deliver strategic racing insights such as pit timing and tire choices, and interactive features like an AI voice assistant and a retro-style racing poster.
