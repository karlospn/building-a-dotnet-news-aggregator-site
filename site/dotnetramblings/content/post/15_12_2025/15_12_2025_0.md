In this post, we introduce checkpointless training on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a paradigm shift in model training that reduces the need for traditional checkpointing by enabling peer-to-peer state recovery. Results from production-scale validation show 80–93% reduction in recovery time (from 15–30 minutes or more to under 2 minutes) and enables up to 95% training goodput on cluster sizes with thousands of AI accelerators.
