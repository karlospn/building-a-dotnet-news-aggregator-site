Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports elastic training, enabling your machine learning (ML) workloads to automatically scale based on resource availability. In this post, we demonstrate how elastic training helps you maximize GPU utilization, reduce costs, and accelerate model development through dynamic resource adaptation, while maintain training quality and minimizing manual intervention.
