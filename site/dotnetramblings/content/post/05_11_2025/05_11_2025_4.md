As a challenge, a colleague of mine told me to find a non-recursive constant-space algorithm for deleting a binary tree.¹ After a moment's thought, I was able to come up with an algorithm. It is often the case that solving a problem is easier once you are told that a solution exists. When I asked the Internet for a non-recu
