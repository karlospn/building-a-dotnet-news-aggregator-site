In this post, we show you how Amazon Search optimized GPU instance utilization by leveraging AWS Batch for SageMaker Training jobs. This managed solution enabled us to orchestrate machine learning (ML) training workloads on GPU-accelerated instance families like P5, P4, and others. We will also provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the use case implementation.
