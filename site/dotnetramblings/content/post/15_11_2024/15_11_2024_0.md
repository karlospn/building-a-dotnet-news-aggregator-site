In this post, we discuss how GoDaddy’s Care & Services team, in close collaboration with the  AWS GenAI Labs team, built Lighthouse—a generative AI solution powered by Amazon Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. With Amazon Bedrock, GoDaddy’s Lighthouse mines insights from customer care interactions using crafted prompts to identify top call drivers and reduce friction points in customers’ product and website experiences, leading to improved customer experience.
