The C# compiler is smart enough to understand some constructs and generates optimized code. However, C# gives you multiple ways to express the same intent. The compiler is not always smart enough to optimize every single ways. In this post, I will show you how to use pattern matching syntax to improve the performance of your code in some cases. Here's an example that checks if a version number is one ofâ€¦
