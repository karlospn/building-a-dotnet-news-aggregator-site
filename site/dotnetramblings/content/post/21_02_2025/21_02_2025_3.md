In this post, we present the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework as a compound AI system implemented by the DSPy framework. The framework first generates a synthetic dataset from the domain knowledge base and documents for self-instruction, then drives model fine-tuning through SFT, and introduces the human-in-the-loop workflow to collect human and AI feedback to the model response, which is used to further improve the model performance by aligning human preference through reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF).
