This intelligent document processing solution uses Amazon Bedrock FMs to orchestrate a sophisticated workflow for handling multi-page healthcare documents with mixed content types. The solution uses the FMâ€™s tool use capabilities, accessed through the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. This enables the FMs to not just process text, but to actively engage with various external tools and APIs to perform complex document analysis tasks.
