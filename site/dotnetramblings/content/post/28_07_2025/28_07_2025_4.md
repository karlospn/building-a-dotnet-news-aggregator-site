This post explores how the AWS Serverless MCP server accelerates development throughout the serverless lifecycle, from making architectural decisions with tools like get_iac_guidance and get_lambda_guidance, to streamlining development with get_serverless_templates, sam_init, to deployment with SAM integration, webapp_deployment_help, and configure_domain. We show how this conversational AI approach transforms the entire process, from architecture design through operations, dramatically accelerating AWS serverless projects while adhering to architectural principles.
