Today, we are happy to announce the general availability of cross-region inference, a powerful feature allowing automatic cross-region inference routing for requests coming to Amazon Bedrock. This offers developers using on-demand inference mode, a seamless solution for managing optimal availability, performance, and resiliency while managing incoming traffic spikes of applications powered by Amazon Bedrock. By opting in, developers no longer have to spend time and effort predicting demand fluctuations.
