This content explains the usage of Enums in programming, cautioning against relying solely on Enum values for human-readable names from databases due to potential performance issues. It introduces EnumHelper and EnumExtensions in Spargine, providing methods like GetValues() and GetDescription(). The article also discusses the Enumeration class as a solution to surpass Enum limitations, offering flexibility for custom names and methods like FromDisplayName. This extends Enum functionality and provides more versatility when Enum's constraints are exceeded.
