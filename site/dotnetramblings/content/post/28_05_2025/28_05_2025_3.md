This post explores deploying a text-to-SQL pipeline using generative AI models and Amazon Bedrock to ask natural language questions to a genomics database. We demonstrate how to implement an AI assistant web interface with AWS Amplify and explain the prompt engineering strategies adopted to generate the SQL queries. Finally, we present instructions to deploy the service in your own AWS account.
