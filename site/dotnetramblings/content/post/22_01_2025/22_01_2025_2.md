In this post, we show you an innovative solution to a challenge faced by security teams in highly regulated industries: the efficient security analysis of vast amounts of video recordings from Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems. We demonstrate how you can use Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3 family of models and Amazon Bedrock to perform the complex task of analyzing video recordings of server console sessions and perform queries to highlight any potential security anomalies.
