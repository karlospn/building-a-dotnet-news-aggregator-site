NinjaTech AI’s mission is to make everyone more productive by taking care of time-consuming complex tasks with fast and affordable artificial intelligence (AI) agents. We recently launched MyNinja.ai, one of the world’s first multi-agent personal AI assistants, to drive towards our mission. MyNinja.ai is built from the ground up using specialized agents that are capable of completing tasks on your behalf, including scheduling meetings, conducting deep research from the web, generating code, and helping with writing. These agents can break down complicated, multi-step tasks into branched solutions, and are capable of evaluating the generated solutions dynamically while continually learning from past experiences. All of these tasks are accomplished in a fully autonomous and asynchronous manner, freeing you up to continue your day while Ninja works on these tasks in the background, and engaging when your input is required.
