HERE collaborated with the GenAIIC. Our joint mission was to create an intelligent AI coding assistant that could provide explanations and executable code solutions in response to usersâ€™ natural language queries. The requirement was to build a scalable system that could translate natural language questions into HTML code with embedded JavaScript, ready for immediate rendering as an interactive map that users can see on screen.
