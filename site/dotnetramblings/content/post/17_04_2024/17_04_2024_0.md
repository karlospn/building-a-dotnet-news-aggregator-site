In this article, we will explore the role, significance, usage, and impact of invariance <T>, contravariance <in T> and covariance <out T> in our C# generics programming. Generics in C# enable us to design flexible, reusable classes and methods, providing type safety without the need for excessive casting or the risk of runtime errors. However, [â€¦]
