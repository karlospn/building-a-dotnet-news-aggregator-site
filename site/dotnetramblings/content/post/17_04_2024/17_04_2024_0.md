The use of a single character with a StringBuilder from an ObjectPool can improve performance. Benchmark results show similar overall performance, but without an ObjectPool, using a character becomes more significant. It is recommended to use a character in such cases. EditorConfig setup can check for this issue using dotnet_diagnostic.CA1834.severity = warning.
