In this post, we show how to extend Amazon Bedrock Agents to hybrid and edge services such as AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones to build distributed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with on-premises data for improved model outcomes. With Outposts, we also cover a reference pattern for a fully local RAG application that requires both the foundation model (FM) and data sources to reside on premises.
