The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is a powerful tool for accelerating application deployment to Microsoft Azure. While azd defaults to Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment, you can configure it to work with HashiCorp Terraform too! This enables azd to be configured not just for Terraform deployments, but also to support cloud-agnostic IaC [â€¦]
