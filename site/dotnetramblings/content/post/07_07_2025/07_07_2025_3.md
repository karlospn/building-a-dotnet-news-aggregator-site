In this post, we show how to build a fully deployable solution that processes video streams using OpenCV, Amazon Bedrock for contextual scene understanding and automated responses through Amazon Bedrock Agents. This solution extends the capabilities demonstrated in Automate chatbot for document and data retrieval using Amazon Bedrock Agents and Knowledge Bases, which discussed using Amazon Bedrock Agents for document and data retrieval. In this post, we apply Amazon Bedrock Agents to real-time video analysis and event monitoring.
