Today, we are excited to announce that Qwen3, the latest generation of large language models (LLMs) in the Qwen family, is available through Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. With this launch, you can deploy the Qwen3 models—available in 0.6B, 4B, 8B, and 32B parameter sizes—to build, experiment, and responsibly scale your generative AI applications on AWS. In this post, we demonstrate how to get started with Qwen3 on Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and SageMaker JumpStart.
