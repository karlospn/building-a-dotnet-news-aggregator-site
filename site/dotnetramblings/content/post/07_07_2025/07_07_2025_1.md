Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems consume valuable resources by ingesting and maintaining embeddings for documents that might never be queried, resulting in unnecessary storage costs and reduced system efficiency. This post presents a just-in-time knowledge base solution that reduces unused consumption through intelligent document processing. The solution processes documents only when needed and automatically removes unused resources, so organizations can scale their document repositories without proportionally increasing infrastructure costs.
