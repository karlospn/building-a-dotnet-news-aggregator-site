Bedrock multi-agent collaboration enables developers to build, deploy, and manage multiple specialized agents working together seamlessly to address increasingly complex business workflows. In this post, we show you how agentic workflows with Amazon Bedrock Agents can help accelerate this journey for research scientists with a natural language interface. We define an example analysis pipeline, specifically for lung cancer survival with clinical, genomics, and imaging modalities of biomarkers. We showcase a variety of specialized agents including a biomarker database analyst, statistician, clinical evidence researcher, and medical imaging expert in collaboration with a supervisor agent. We demonstrate advanced capabilities of agents for self-review and planning that help build trust with end users by breaking down complex tasks into a series of steps and showing the chain of thought to generate the final answer.
