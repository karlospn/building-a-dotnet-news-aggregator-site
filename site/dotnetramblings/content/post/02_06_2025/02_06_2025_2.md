In this post, we explore how to use Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to build intelligent applications. Unlike traditional vector search, which retrieves documents based on similarity scores, knowledge graphs encode relationships between entities, allowing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve information with context-aware reasoning.
