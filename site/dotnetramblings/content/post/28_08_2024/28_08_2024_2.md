In this post, we show you how to use Amazon Bedrock to automate email responses to customer queries. With our solution, you can identify the intent of customer emails and send an automated response if the intent matches your existing knowledge base or data sources. If the intent doesnâ€™t have a match, the email goes to the support team for a manual response.
