In this blog post, we will show you how to implement tenant isolation using Amazon Bedrock agents within a multi-tenant environment. Weâ€™ll demonstrate this using a sample multi-tenant e-commerce application that provides a service for various tenants to create online stores. This application will use Amazon Bedrock agents to develop an AI assistant or chatbot capable of providing tenant-specific information, such as return policies and user-specific information like order counts and status updates.
