In this post, we discuss existing prompt-level threats and outline several security guardrails for mitigating prompt-level threats. For our example, we work with Anthropic Claude on Amazon Bedrock, implementing prompt templates that allow us to enforce guardrails against common security threats such as prompt injection. These templates are compatible with and can be modified for other LLMs.
