Through this series of posts, we share our generative AI journey and use cases, detailing the architecture, AWS services used, lessons learned, and the impact of these solutions on our teams and customers. In this first post, we explore Account Summaries, one of our initial production use cases built on Amazon Bedrock. Account Summaries equips our teams to be better prepared for customer engagements. It combines information from various sources into comprehensive, on-demand summaries available in our CRM or proactively delivered based on upcoming meetings. From the period of September 2023 to March 2024, sellers leveraging GenAI Account Summaries saw a 4.9% increase in value of opportunities created.
