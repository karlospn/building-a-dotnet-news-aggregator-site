Lettria, an AWS Partner, demonstrated that integrating graph-based structures into RAG workflows improves answer precision by up to 35% compared to vector-only retrieval methods. In this post, we explore why GraphRAG is more comprehensive and explainable than vector RAG alone, and how you can use this approach using AWS services and Lettria.
