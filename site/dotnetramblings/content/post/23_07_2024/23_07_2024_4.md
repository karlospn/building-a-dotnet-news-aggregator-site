Today, we are excited to announce that the state-of-the-art Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual large language models (LLMs), which includes pre-trained and instruction tuned generative AI models in 8B, 70B, and 405B sizes, is available through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to deploy for inference. Llama is a publicly accessible LLM designed for developers, researchers, and businesses to build, experiment, and responsibly scale their generative artificial intelligence (AI) ideas. In this post, we walk through how to discover and deploy Llama 3.1 models using SageMaker JumpStart.
