In this post, we explore two approaches for securing sensitive data in RAG applications using Amazon Bedrock. The first approach focused on identifying and redacting sensitive data before ingestion into an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and the second demonstrated a fine-grained RBAC pattern for managing access to sensitive information during retrieval. These solutions represent just two possible approaches among many for securing sensitive data in generative AI applications.
