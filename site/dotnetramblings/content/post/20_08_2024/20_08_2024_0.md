While presigned URLs offer a convenient way to grant temporary access to S3 objects, sharing these URLs with people outside of the workteam can lead to unintended access of those objects. To mitigate this risk and enhance the security of SageMaker Ground Truth labeling tasks, we have introduced a new feature that adds an additional layer of security by restricting access to the presigned URLs to the workerâ€™s IP address or virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint from which they access the labeling task. In this blog post, we show you how to enable this feature, allowing you to enhance your data security as needed, and outline the success criteria for this feature, including the scenarios where it will be most beneficial.
