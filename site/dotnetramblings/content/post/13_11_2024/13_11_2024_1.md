You can now register machine learning (ML) models in Amazon SageMaker Model Registry with Amazon SageMaker Model Cards, making it straightforward to manage governance information for specific model versions directly in SageMaker Model Registry in just a few clicks. In this post, we discuss a new feature that supports the integration of model cards with the model registry. We discuss the solution architecture and best practices for managing model cards with a registered model version, and walk through how to set up, operationalize, and govern your models using the integration in the model registry.
