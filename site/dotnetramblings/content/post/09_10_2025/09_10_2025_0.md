In this post, we demonstrate how to integrate Amazon SageMaker HyperPod with Anyscale platform to address critical infrastructure challenges in building and deploying large-scale AI models. The combined solution provides robust infrastructure for distributed AI workloads with high-performance hardware, continuous monitoring, and seamless integration with Ray, the leading AI compute engine, enabling organizations to reduce time-to-market and lower total cost of ownership.
