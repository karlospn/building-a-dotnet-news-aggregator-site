The repositories for MT-Bench and Arena-Hard were originally developed using OpenAI’s GPT API, primarily employing GPT-4 as the judge. Our team has expanded its functionality by integrating it with the Amazon Bedrock API to enable using Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet on Amazon as judge. In this post, we use both MT-Bench and Arena-Hard to benchmark Amazon Nova models by comparing them to other leading LLMs available through Amazon Bedrock.
