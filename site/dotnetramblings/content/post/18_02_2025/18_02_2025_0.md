In this post, we explain how F1 and AWS have developed a root cause analysis (RCA) assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock to reduce manual intervention and accelerate the resolution of recurrent operational issues during races from weeks to minutes. The RCA assistant enables the F1 team to spend more time on innovation and improving its services, ultimately delivering an exceptional experience for fans and partners. The successful collaboration between F1 and AWS showcases the transformative potential of generative AI in empowering teams to accomplish more in less time.
