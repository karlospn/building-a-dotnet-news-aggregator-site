The need to efficiently search and retrieve documents based on their semantic content is more important than ever—especially when building Generative AI systems that implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) design pattern. One robust approach to achieve this is by using vector representations of text data. These vectors, generated using advanced embedding models like Azure […]
