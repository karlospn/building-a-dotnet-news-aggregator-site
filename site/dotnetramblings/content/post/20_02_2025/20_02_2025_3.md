In this post, we explore how you can use LLMs with advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate high-quality synthetic data for a finance domain use case. You can use the same technique for synthetic data for other business domain use cases as well. For this post, we demonstrate how to generate counterparty risk (CR) data, which would be beneficial for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are traded directly between two parties, without going through a formal exchange.
