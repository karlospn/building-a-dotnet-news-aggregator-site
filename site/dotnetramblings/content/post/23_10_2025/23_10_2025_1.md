In this post, we explore an innovative approach that converts natural language to Gremlin queries using Amazon Bedrock models such as Amazon Nova Pro, helping business analysts and data scientists access graph databases without requiring deep technical expertise. The methodology involves three key steps: extracting graph knowledge, structuring the graph similar to text-to-SQL processing, and generating executable Gremlin queries through an iterative refinement process that achieved 74.17% overall accuracy in testing.
