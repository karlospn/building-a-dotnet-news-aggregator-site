In this post, we demonstrate how to migrate computer vision workloads from Amazon Lookout for Vision to Amazon SageMaker AI by training custom defect detection models using pre-trained models available on AWS Marketplace. We provide step-by-step guidance on labeling datasets with SageMaker Ground Truth, training models with flexible hyperparameter configurations, and deploying them for real-time or batch inference—giving you greater control and flexibility for automated quality inspection use cases.
