Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes the world’s most differentiated and complete portfolio of content and brands across television, film and streaming. In this post, we describe the scale of our offerings, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) inference infrastructure requirements for our real time recommender systems, and how we used AWS Graviton-based Amazon SageMaker AI instances for our ML inference workloads and achieved 60% cost savings and 7% to 60% latency improvements across different models.
