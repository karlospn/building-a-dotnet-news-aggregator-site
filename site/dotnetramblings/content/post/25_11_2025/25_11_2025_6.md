We're introducing bidirectional streaming for Amazon SageMaker AI Inference, which transforms inference from a transactional exchange into a continuous conversation. This post shows you how to build and deploy a container with bidirectional streaming capability to a SageMaker AI endpoint. We also demonstrate how you can bring your own container or use our partner Deepgram's pre-built models and containers on SageMaker AI to enable bi-directional streaming feature for real-time inference.
