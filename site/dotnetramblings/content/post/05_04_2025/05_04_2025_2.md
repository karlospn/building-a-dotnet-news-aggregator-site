Microsoft is holding an AI Agents Hackathon, and we want to see what you can build with Python! We'll have 20+ live streams showing you how to build AI agents with Python using popular agent frameworks and Microsoft technologies. Then, you can submit your project for a chance to win prizes, including a Best in Python prize!
