A customer encountered a hang caused by COM not pumping messages while waiting for a cross-thread operation to complete. They were using the task_sequencer class for serializing asynchronous operations on a UI thread they created to handle accessibility callbacks. The hang stack looked like this: ntdll!ZwWaitForMultipleObjects+0x4 KERNELBASE!WaitForMultipleObjectsEx+0xe0 combase!MTAThreadDispatchCrossApartmentCall+0x3a0 combase!CSyncClientCall::SendReceive2+0x65c combase!DefaultSendReceive+0x88 combase!CSyncClientCall::SendReceive+0x390 combase!CClientChannel::SendReceive+0xc0 combase!NdrExtpProxySendReceive+0x68 rpcrt4!NdrpClientCall3+0x764 combase!ObjectStublessClient+0x180 [â€¦]
