In this post, we discuss how Amazon SageMaker and Tecton work together to simplify the development and deployment of production-ready AI applications, particularly for real-time use cases like fraud detection. The integration enables faster time to value by abstracting away complex engineering tasks, allowing teams to focus on building features and use cases while providing a streamlined framework for both offline training and online serving of ML models.
