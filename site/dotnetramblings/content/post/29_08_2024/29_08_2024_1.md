The AWS DeepRacer League is the world’s first autonomous racing league, open to everyone and powered by machine learning (ML). AWS DeepRacer brings builders together from around the world, creating a community where you learn ML hands-on through friendly autonomous racing competitions. As we celebrate the achievements of over 560,000 participants from more than 150 countries who sharpened their skills through the AWS DeepRacer League over the last 6 years, we also prepare to close this chapter with a final season that serves as both a victory lap and a launching point for what’s next in the world of AWS DeepRacer.
