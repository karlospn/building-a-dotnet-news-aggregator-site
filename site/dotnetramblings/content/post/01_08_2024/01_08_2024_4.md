In this post, we demonstrate the process of fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B on SageMaker to specialize it in the generation of SQL queries (text-to-SQL). Meta Llama 3 8B is a relatively small model that offers a balance between performance and resource efficiency. AWS customers have explored fine-tuning Meta Llama 3 8B for the generation of SQL queries—especially when using non-standard SQL dialects—and have requested methods to import their customized models into Amazon Bedrock to benefit from the managed infrastructure and security that Amazon Bedrock provides when serving those models.
