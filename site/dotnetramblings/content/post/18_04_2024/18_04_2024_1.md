You’ve likely experienced the challenge of taking notes during a meeting while trying to pay attention to the conversation. You’ve probably also experienced the need to quickly fact-check something that’s been said, or look up information to answer a question that’s just been asked in the call. Or maybe you have a team member that always joins meetings late, and expects you to send them a quick summary over chat to catch them up. Then there are the times that others are talking in a language that’s not your first language, and you’d love to have a live translation of what people are saying to make sure you understand correctly. And after the call is over, you usually want to capture a summary for your records, or to send to the participants, with a list of all the action items, owners, and due dates. All of this, and more, is now possible with our newest sample solution, Live Meeting Assistant (LMA).
