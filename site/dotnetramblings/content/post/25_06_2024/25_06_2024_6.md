In this blog post, we will share some of capabilities to help you get quick and easy visibility into Amazon Bedrock workloads in context of your broader application. We will use the contextual conversational assistant example in the Amazon Bedrock GitHub repository to provide examples of how you can customize these views to further enhance visibility, tailored to your use case. Specifically, we will describe how you can use the new automatic dashboard in Amazon CloudWatch to get a single pane of glass visibility into the usage and performance of Amazon Bedrock models and gain end-to-end visibility by customizing dashboards with widgets that provide visibility and insights into components and operations such as Retrieval Augmented Generation in your application.
