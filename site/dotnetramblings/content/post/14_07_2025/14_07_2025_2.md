In this post, we explore how to build a secure RAG application using serverless data lake architecture, an important data strategy to support generative AI development. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) services including Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to create a comprehensive solution supporting unstructured data assets which can be extended to structured data. The post covers how to implement fine-grained access controls for your enterprise data and design metadata-driven retrieval systems that respect security boundaries. These approaches will help you maximize the value of your organization's data while maintaining robust security and compliance.
