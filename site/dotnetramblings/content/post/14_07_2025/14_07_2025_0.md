Sonatus partnered with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to develop a natural language interface to generate data collection and automation policies using generative AI. This innovation aims to reduce the policy generation process from days to minutes while making it accessible to both engineers and non-experts alike. In this post, we explore how we built this system using Sonatusâ€™s Collector AI and Amazon Bedrock. We discuss the background, challenges, and high-level solution architecture.
