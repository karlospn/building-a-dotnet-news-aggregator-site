Introduction
A command that many shells have had forever and that PowerShell has had for a long time as well is ‘cd -’ which means “change directory to previous folder”. This means you could do something like this:


1
2
3
4
5
6


> cd c:\dev
c:\dev
> cd c:\temp
c:\temp
> cd -
c:\dev


This is quite handy in many situations. In particular, since I’ve modified my PowerShell Profile to NOT start in my users folder but instead to start in my c:\dev folder (from which I can easily get to any repo I may be working from), I very often find myself using cd - whenever I create a new terminal in the folder I want to be in such as when using VS Code.
