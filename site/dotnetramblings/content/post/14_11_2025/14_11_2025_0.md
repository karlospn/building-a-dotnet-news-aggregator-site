In this post, we demonstrate how to build a production-ready biomedical research agent by integrating Biomni's specialized tools with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, enabling researchers to access over 30 biomedical databases through a secure, scalable infrastructure. The implementation showcases how to transform research prototypes into enterprise-grade systems with persistent memory, semantic tool discovery, and comprehensive observability for scientific reproducibility .
