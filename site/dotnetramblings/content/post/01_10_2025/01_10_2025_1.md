ArrayPool optimizes memory usage by providing a thread-safe pool of reusable arrays, significantly reducing allocations and garbage collection pressure, especially in high-performance scenarios. It's effective for I/O, serialization, and media processing. Best practices include tight scope management, clearing sensitive data on return, and careful tracking of logical array lengths.
