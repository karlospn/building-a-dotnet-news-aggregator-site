In this post, we explore how to programmatically create an IDP solution that uses Strands SDK, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, and Bedrock Data Automation (BDA). This solution is provided through a Jupyter notebook that enables users to upload multi-modal business documents and extract insights using BDA as a parser to retrieve relevant chunks and augment a prompt to a foundational model (FM).
