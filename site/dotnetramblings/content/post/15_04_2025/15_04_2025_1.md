This post demonstrates how to deploy and serve the Mixtral 8x7B language model on AWS Inferentia2 instances for cost-effective, high-performance inference. We'll walk through model compilation using Hugging Face Optimum Neuron, which provides a set of tools enabling straightforward model loading, training, and inference, and the Text Generation Inference (TGI) Container, which has the toolkit for deploying and serving LLMs with Hugging Face.
