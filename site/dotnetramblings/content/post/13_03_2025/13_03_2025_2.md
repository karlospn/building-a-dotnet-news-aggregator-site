This post begins a blog series exploring DeepSeek and open FMs on Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. It covers the process of performance benchmarking of custom models in Amazon Bedrock using popular open source tools: LLMPerf and LiteLLM. It includes a notebook that includes step-by-step instructions to deploy a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, but the same steps apply for any other model supported by Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import.
