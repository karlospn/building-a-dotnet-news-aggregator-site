In this post, we provide a detailed, hands-on guide to implementing Fast Model Loader in your LLM deployments. We explore two approaches: using the SageMaker Python SDK for programmatic implementation, and using the Amazon SageMaker Studio UI for a more visual, interactive experience. Whether you’re a developer who prefers working with code or someone who favors a graphical interface, you’ll learn how to take advantage of this powerful feature to accelerate your LLM deployments.
