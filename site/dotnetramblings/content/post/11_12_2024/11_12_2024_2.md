In this post, we illustrate the importance of generative AI in the collaboration between Tealium and the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) team by automating the following: 1/ Evaluating the retriever and the generated answer of a RAG system based on the Ragas Repository powered by Amazon Bedrock, 2/ Generating improved instructions for each question-and-answer pair using an automatic prompt engineering technique based on the Auto-Instruct Repository. An instruction refers to a general direction or command given to the model to guide generation of a response. These instructions were generated using Anthropicâ€™s Claude on Amazon Bedrock, and 4/ Providing a UI for a human-based feedback mechanism that complements an evaluation system powered by Amazon Bedrock.
