Building on this foundation of specialized information extraction solutions and using the capabilities of SageMaker HyperPod, we collaborate with APOIDEA Group to explore the use of large vision language models (LVLMs) to further improve table structure recognition performance on banking and financial documents. In this post, we present our work and step-by-step code on fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct model using LLaMA-Factory on SageMaker HyperPod.
