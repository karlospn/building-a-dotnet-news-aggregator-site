In this post, we show how to use FMEval and Amazon SageMaker to programmatically evaluate LLMs. FMEval is an open source LLM evaluation library, designed to provide data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers with a code-first experience to evaluate LLMs for various aspects, including accuracy, toxicity, fairness, robustness, and efficiency.
