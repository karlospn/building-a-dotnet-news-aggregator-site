In this post, we explore how Amazon Bedrock latency-optimized inference can help address the challenges of maintaining responsiveness in LLM applications. We'll dive deep into strategies for optimizing application performance and improving user experience. Whether you're building a new AI application or optimizing an existing one, you'll find practical guidance on both the technical aspects of latency optimization and real-world implementation approaches. We begin by explaining latency in LLM applications.
