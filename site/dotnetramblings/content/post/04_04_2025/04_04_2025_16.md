In optimizing the Spargine project, I improved performance by avoiding constant arrays as method arguments. Instead, using static readonly fields reduced memory allocations significantly. This change enhanced execution speed, yielding a 1.34x performance gain. I recommend enabling CA1856 warnings in .editorconfig to maintain performance-focused coding practices.
