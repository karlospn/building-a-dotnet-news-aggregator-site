Spargine is a collection of open-source .NET assemblies and NuGet packages designed for enhanced functionality, featuring the ExecutionHelper methods: ProgressiveRetry() and ProgressiveRetryAsync(). These methods manage transient operation failures with retry logic and progressive delays. Additionally, proactive resource checks like IsNetworkAvailable() improve application reliability by checking resource availability before retrying.
