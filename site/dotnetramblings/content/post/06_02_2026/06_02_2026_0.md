Today, we're announcing structured outputs on Amazon Bedrock—a capability that fundamentally transforms how you can obtain validated JSON responses from foundation models through constrained decoding for schema compliance. In this post, we explore the challenges of traditional JSON generation and how structured outputs solves them.
