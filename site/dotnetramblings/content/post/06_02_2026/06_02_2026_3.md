In this post, we explore the Amazon Nova rubric-based judge feature: what a rubric-based judge is, how the judge is trained, what metrics to consider, and how to calibrate the judge. We chare notebook code of the Amazon Nova rubric-based LLM-as-a-judge methodology to evaluate and compare the outputs of two different LLMs using SageMaker training jobs.
