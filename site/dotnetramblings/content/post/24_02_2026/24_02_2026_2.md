In this post, we demonstrate how to train CodeFu-7B, a specialized 7-billion parameter model for competitive programming, using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with veRL, a flexible and efficient training library for large language models (LLMs) that enables straightforward extension of diverse RL algorithms and seamless integration with existing LLM infrastructure, within a distributed Ray cluster managed by SageMaker training jobs. We walk through the complete implementation, covering data preparation, distributed training setup, and comprehensive observability, showcasing how this unified approach delivers both computational scale and developer experience for sophisticated RL training workloads.
