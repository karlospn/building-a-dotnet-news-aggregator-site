In the fashion industry, teams are frequently innovating quickly, often utilizing AI. Sharing content, whether it be through videos, designs, or otherwise, can lead to content moderation challenges. There remains a risk (through intentional or unintentional actions) of inappropriate, offensive, or toxic content being produced and shared. In this post, we cover the use of the multimodal toxicity detection feature of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to guard against toxic content. Whether you’re an enterprise giant in the fashion industry or an up-and-coming brand, you can use this solution to screen potentially harmful content before it impacts your brand’s reputation and ethical standards. For the purposes of this post, ethical standards refer to toxic, disrespectful, or harmful content and images that could be created by fashion designers.
