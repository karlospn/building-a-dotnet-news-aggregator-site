This post presents an end-to-end IDP application powered by Amazon Bedrock Data Automation and other AWS services. It provides a reusable AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) that deploys an IDP pipeline and provides an intuitive UI for transforming documents into structured tables at scale. The application only requires the user to provide the input documents (such as contracts or emails) and a list of attributes to be extracted. It then performs IDP with generative AI.
