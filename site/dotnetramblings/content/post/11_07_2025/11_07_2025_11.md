In Part 1 of this series, you learned how you can use the combination of Amazon Bedrock and Pipecat, an open source framework for voice and multimodal conversational AI agents to build applications with human-like conversational AI. You learned about common use cases of voice agents and the cascaded models approach, where you orchestrate several components to build your voice AI agent. In this post (Part 2), you explore how to use speech-to-speech foundation model, Amazon Nova Sonic, and the benefits of using a unified model.
