In this post, we demonstrate how to use H-optimus-0 for two common digital pathology tasks: patch-level analysis for detailed tissue examination, and slide-level analysis for broader diagnostic assessment. Through practical examples, we show you how to adapt this FM to these specific use cases while optimizing computational resources.
