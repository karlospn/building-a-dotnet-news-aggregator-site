This post introduces an innovative voice-based application workflow that harnesses the power of Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Transcribe, and React to systematically capture and document institutional knowledge through voice recordings from experienced staff members. Our solution uses Amazon Transcribe for real-time speech-to-text conversion, enabling accurate and immediate documentation of spoken knowledge. We then use generative AI, powered by Amazon Bedrock, to analyze and summarize the transcribed content, extracting key insights and generating comprehensive documentation.
