In this post, we showcase how to fine-tune a sentence transformer specifically for classifying an Amazon product into its product category (such as toys or sporting goods). We showcase two different sentence transformers, paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 and a proprietary Amazon large language model (LLM) called M5_ASIN_SMALL_V2.0, and compare their results.
