Today, Mistral AI is bringing its latest and most capable model, Mistral Large, to Amazon Bedrock, and is committed to making future models accessible to AWS customers. Mistral AI will alsoÂ use AWS AI-optimized AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia to build and deploy its future foundation models on Amazon Bedrock, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS. Along with this announcement, starting today, customers can use Amazon Bedrock in the AWS Europe (Paris) Region. At launch, customers will have access to some of the latest models from Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, and Mistral AI, expanding their options to support various use cases from text understanding to complex reasoning.
