In this post, we detail how Metagenomi partnered with AWS to implement the Progen2 protein language model on AWS Inferentia, achieving up to 56% cost reduction for high-throughput enzyme generation workflows. The implementation enabled cost-effective generation of millions of novel enzyme variants using EC2 Inf2 Spot Instances and AWS Batch, demonstrating how cloud-based generative AI can make large-scale protein design more accessible for biotechnology applications .
