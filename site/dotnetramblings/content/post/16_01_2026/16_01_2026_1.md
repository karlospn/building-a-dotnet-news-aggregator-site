In this post, we show you how fine-tuning enabled a 33% reduction in dangerous medication errors (Amazon Pharmacy), engineering 80% human effort reduction (Amazon Global Engineering Services), and content quality assessments improving 77% to 96% accuracy (Amazon A+). This post details the techniques behind these outcomes: from foundational methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (instruction tuning), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for human alignment, to cutting-edge reasoning optimizations such as Grouped-based Reinforcement Learning from Policy Optimization (GRPO), Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), and Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) purpose-built for agentic systems.
