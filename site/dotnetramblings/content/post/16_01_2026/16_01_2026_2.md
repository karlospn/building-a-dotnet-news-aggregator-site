Palo Alto Networks’ Device Security team wanted to detect early warning signs of potential production issues to provide more time to SMEs to react to these emerging problems. They partnered with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC) to develop an automated log classification pipeline powered by Amazon Bedrock. In this post, we discuss how Amazon Bedrock, through Anthropic’ s Claude Haiku model, and Amazon Titan Text Embeddings work together to automatically classify and analyze log data. We explore how this automated pipeline detects critical issues, examine the solution architecture, and share implementation insights that have delivered measurable operational improvements.
