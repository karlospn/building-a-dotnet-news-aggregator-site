In this post, we demonstrate how to deploy distilled versions of DeepSeek-R1 models using Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import. We focus on importing the variants currently supported DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, which offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency.
