In this post, we demonstrate how you can use Amazon SageMaker HyperPod training plans, to bring down your training cluster procurement wait time. We guide you through a step-by-step implementation on how you can use the (AWS CLI) or the AWS Management Console to find, review, and create optimal training plans for your specific compute and timeline needs. We further guide you through using the training plan to submit SageMaker training jobs or create SageMaker HyperPod clusters.
