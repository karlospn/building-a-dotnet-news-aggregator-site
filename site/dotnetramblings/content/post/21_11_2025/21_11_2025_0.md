In this post, we introduce the Multi-Provider Generative AI Gateway reference architecture, which provides guidance for deploying LiteLLM into an AWS environment to streamline the management and governance of production generative AI workloads across multiple model providers. This centralized gateway solution addresses common enterprise challenges including provider fragmentation, decentralized governance, operational complexity, and cost management by offering a unified interface that supports Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker AI, and external providers while maintaining comprehensive security, monitoring, and control capabilities.
