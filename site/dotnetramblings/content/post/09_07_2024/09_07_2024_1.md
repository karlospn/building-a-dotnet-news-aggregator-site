Today, Amazon SageMaker announced a new inference optimization toolkit that helps you reduce the time it takes to optimize generative artificial intelligence (AI) models from months to hours, to achieve best-in-class performance for your use case. With this new capability, you can choose from a menu of optimization techniques, apply them to your generative AI […]
