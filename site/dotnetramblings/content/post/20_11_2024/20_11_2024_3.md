In this post, we explore an innovative approach that uses LLMs on Amazon Bedrock to intelligently extract metadata filters from natural language queries. By combining the capabilities of LLM function calling and Pydantic data models, you can dynamically extract metadata from user queries. This approach can also enhance the quality of retrieved information and responses generated by the RAG applications.
