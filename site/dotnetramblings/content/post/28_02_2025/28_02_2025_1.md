The AWS DeepRacer League is the world's first global autonomous racing league powered by machine learning (ML). Over the past 6 years, a diverse community of over 560,000 builders from more than 150 countries worldwide have participated in the League to learn ML fundamentals hands-on through the fun of friendly autonomous racing. After an 8-month season of nail-biting virtual qualifiers, finalists convened in person at re:Invent in Las Vegas for one final showdown to compete for prizes and glory in the high-stakes, winner-take-all AWS DeepRacer League Championship.
