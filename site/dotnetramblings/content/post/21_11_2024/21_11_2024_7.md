Fine-tuning foundation models (FMs) is a process that involves exposing a pre-trained FM to task-specific data and fine-tuning its parameters. It can then develop a deeper understanding and produce more accurate and relevant outputs for that particular domain. In this post, we show how to use an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot training job with the AutoMLV2 [â€¦]
