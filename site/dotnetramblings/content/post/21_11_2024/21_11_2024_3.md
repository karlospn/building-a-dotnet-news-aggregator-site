we’re excited to share the journey of the VW—an innovator in the automotive industry and Europe’s largest car maker—to enhance knowledge management by using generative AI, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Kendra to devise a solution based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that makes internal information more easily accessible by its users. This solution efficiently handles documents that include both text and images, significantly enhancing VW's knowledge management capabilities within their production domain.
