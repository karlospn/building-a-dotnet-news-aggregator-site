In this post, we show how you can build an automated, serverless solution to transform webinar recordings into comprehensive handouts using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for video analysis. We walk you through the implementation of Amazon Bedrock Data Automation to transcribe and detect slide changes, as well as the use of Amazon Bedrock foundation models (FMs) for transcription refinement, combined with custom AWS Lambda functions orchestrated by AWS Step Functions.
