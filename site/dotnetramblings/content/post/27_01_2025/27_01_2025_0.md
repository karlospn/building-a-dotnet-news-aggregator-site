This post walks you through the end-to-end process of deploying a single custom model on SageMaker using NASAâ€™s Prithvi model. The Prithvi model is a first-of-its-kind temporal Vision transformer pre-trained by the IBM and NASA team on contiguous US Harmonised Landsat Sentinel 2 (HLS) data. It can be finetuned for image segmentation using the mmsegmentation library for use cases like burn scars detection, flood mapping, and multi-temporal crop classification.
