In this post, we demonstrate the implementation of a practical RAG chat-based assistant using a comprehensive stack of modern technologies. The solution uses NVIDIA NIMs for both LLM inference and text embedding services, with the NIM Operator handling their deployment and management. The architecture incorporates Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings for similarity search.
