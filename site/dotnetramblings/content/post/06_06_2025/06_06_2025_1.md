In this post, we demonstrate how to use the Open AI Whisper foundation model (FM) Whisper Large V3 Turbo, available in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, which offers access to over 140 models through a dedicated offering, to produce near real-time transcription. These transcriptions are then processed by Amazon Bedrock for summarization and redaction of sensitive information.
