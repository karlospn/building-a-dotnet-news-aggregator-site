This post evaluates the key options for querying data using generative AI, discusses their strengths and limitations, and demonstrates why Text-to-SQL is the best choice for deterministic, schema-specific tasks. We show how to effectively use Text-to-SQL using Amazon Nova, a foundation model (FM) available in Amazon Bedrock, to derive precise and reliable answers from your data.
