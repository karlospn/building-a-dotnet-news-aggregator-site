Today, weâ€™re announcing a significant enhancement to Amazon Bedrock Guardrails: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy-based enforcement. This powerful capability enables security and compliance teams to establish mandatory guardrails for every model inference call, making sure organizational safety policies are consistently enforced across AI interactions. This feature enhances AI governance by enabling centralized control over guardrail implementation.
