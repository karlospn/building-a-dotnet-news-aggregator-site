We are excited to announce the availability of the Technology Innovation Institute (TII)â€™s Falcon-H1 models on Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. With this launch, developers and data scientists can now use six instruction-tuned Falcon-H1 models (0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-Deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B) on AWS, and have access to a comprehensive suite of hybrid architecture models that combine traditional attention mechanisms with State Space Models (SSMs) to deliver exceptional performance with unprecedented efficiency.
