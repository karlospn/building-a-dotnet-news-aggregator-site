In this post, we announce Amazon SageMaker HyperPod support for deploying foundation models from SageMaker JumpStart, as well as custom or fine-tuned models from Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx. This new capability allows customers to train, fine-tune, and deploy models on the same HyperPod compute resources, maximizing resource utilization across the entire model lifecycle.
