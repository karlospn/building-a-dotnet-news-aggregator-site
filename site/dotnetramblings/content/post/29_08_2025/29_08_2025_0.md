Weâ€™re excited to announce new security capabilities in Datadog Cloud Security that can help you detect and remediate Amazon Bedrock misconfigurations before they become security incidents. This integration helps organizations embed robust security controls and secure their use of the powerful capabilities of Amazon Bedrock by offering three critical advantages: holistic AI security by integrating AI security into your broader cloud security strategy, real-time risk detection through identifying potential AI-related security issues as they emerge, and simplified compliance to help meet evolving AI regulations with pre-built detections.
