As technology continues to evolve, newer models are emerging, offering higher quality, increased flexibility, and faster image generation capabilities. One such groundbreaking model is Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), released by StabilityAI, advancing the text-to-image generative AI technology to unprecedented heights. In this post, we demonstrate how to efficiently fine-tune the SDXL model using SageMaker Studio. We show how to then prepare the fine-tuned model to run on AWS Inferentia2 powered Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances, unlocking superior price performance for your inference workloads.
